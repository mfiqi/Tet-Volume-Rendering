1. Use ray triangle intersection to determine if a ray intersects a triangle.
2. Use Barcyentric coordinates to determine the color at that specific point. 
3. Find the tet that the triangle belongs to. 
4. Determine the new entrance point by performing the ray triangle intersection.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until exit.
6. Accumulate color along the way.


Step 1.

I have to be able to determine the triangle that I am shading in the fragment shader.

To do so, I need to pass unique flat-interpolated vertex IDs to the fragment shader.

From the vertexIds, I should be able to determine the triangle that currently being shaded. 

I need to create unique vertexIDs for each triangle.
