1. Use ray triangle intersection to determine if a ray intersects a triangle.
2. Use Barcyentric coordinates to determine the color at that specific point. 
3. Find the tet that the triangle belongs to. 
4. Determine the new entrance point by performing the ray triangle intersection.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until exit.
6. Accumulate color along the way.
