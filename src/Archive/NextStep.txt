Instead of coloring the object based on ray direction, color it based on the distance from the ray to the intersection point.
Then check if the ray entrance and ray exit colors look correct.

    - Use the ray marching algorithm
    - Detect when an intersection occurs
    - Find the distance of that intersection
    - Use that distance to color the cube

If something goes wrong, check the vertex normal buffers in cubeMesh.ts
